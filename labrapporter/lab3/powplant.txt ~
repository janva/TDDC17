    a) What is the risk of melt-down in the power plant during a day if no observations have been made? What if there is icy weather?
 
		The risk melt-down if no prior observation have been made is.
		0,02578
		
		The risk melt-down if icy weather has been observed 
		0,03472

    b) Suppose that both warning sensors indicate failure. What is the risk of a meltdown in that case?
	   0,14535
	 Compare this result with the risk of a melt-down when there is an actual pump failure and water leak.
	 0.20000
	  What is the difference? The answers must be expressed as conditional probabilities of the observed variables, P(Meltdown|...).
	   P(Meltdown|...)
    c) The conditional probabilities for the stochastic variables are often estimated by repeated experiments or observations. Why is it sometimes very difficult to get accurate numbers for these? What conditional probabilites in the model of the plant do you think are difficult or impossible to estimate?
    d) Assume that the "IcyWeather" variable is changed to a more accurate "Temperature" variable instead (don't change your model). What are the different alternatives for the domain of this variable? What will happen with the probability distribution of P(WaterLeak | Temperature) in each alternative?
