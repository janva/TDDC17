    a) What is the risk of melt-down in the power plant during a day if no observations have been made? What if there is icy weather?
 
		The risk melt-down if no prior observation have been made is.
		0,02578
		
		The risk melt-down if icy weather has been observed 
		0,03472

    b) Suppose that both warning sensors indicate failure. What is the risk of a meltdown in that case?
	     P(Meltdown|pumpFailureWarning ^ waterLeakWarning)	=   0,14535
	 Compare this result with the risk of a melt-down when there is an actual pump failure and water leak.
	 
	 P(Meltdown |pumpfailure ^ waterLeak )=  0.20000
	  What is the difference? The answers must be expressed as conditional probabilities of the observed variables, P(Meltdown|...).
	  
	  The differnence in probability is because actuall pumpFailure and Waterleak have been observed. The direclty effekt 
	  The meltdown node as oppose to PumpFailureWarning and WaterLeakWarning. PumpFailure and waterLeak conditionaly indepent on
	  Pumpfailure warning.
	  	

    c) The conditional probabilities for the stochastic variables are often estimated by repeated experiments or observations.
        Why is it sometimes very difficult to get accurate numbers for these?  
	What conditional probabilites in the model of the plant do you think are difficult or impossible to estimate?
    
	Icy weather is hard to predict  because weather in general is dependent on a lot of parametser which makes the scale
	of predicting weather very large.  All the parameter cant fit in the model which is a simplifictation of the real world.
    

    d) Assume that the "IcyWeather" variable is changed to a more accurate "Temperature" variable instead (don't change your model). 
    What are the different alternatives for the domain of this variable? What will happen with the probability distribution 
    of P(WaterLeak | Temperature) in each alternative?
    
    check continius domains? discrete? .....

questions part 3

During the lunch break, the owner tries to show off for his employees by demonstrating the many features of his car stereo. To everyone's disappointment, it doesn't work. How did the owner's chances of surviving the day change after this observation? 
It decreases chances of survival slightly
given no prior knowledge what so ever the probability of survival is
P(Survival) = <0.99049, 0.00951> and 
P(Survival | Radio=false) =<0.98418,0.01582>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The owner buys a new bicycle that he brings to work every day. The bicycle has the following properties
     
P(bicycle_works) = 0.9 
P(survives | Å moves Å» melt-down Å» bicycle_works) = 0.6 
P(survives | moves Å» melt-down Å» bicycle_works) = 0.9 
 
How does the bicycle change the owner's chances of survival? 

P(Survival) = <0.99522, 0.00478> 
So a slight increase in probobility of survivel given no prior knowledge

 It is possible to model any function in propositional logic with Bayesian Networks. What does this fact say about the complexity of exact inference in Bayesian Networks? What alternatives are there to exact inference? 

In general about complexy of bayesan networks exact inference is an 
intractable problem. The course book mentions methods for approximative 
solutions. (read upp)
